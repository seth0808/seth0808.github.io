Guatemala Christmas Gift Bag Project

I created this website during the summer of 2016 to promote donations for my project. The purpose of this project was to raise money to build and send Christmas bags to children in Guatemala who were not expecting to have their own. With the website I was able to raise over $1000 to make gift bags thanks to the support I received. Although initially planned on github, I hosted the final website on orionhub. I have come back to post the source code here as well.
